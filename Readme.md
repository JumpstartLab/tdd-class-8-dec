## Monday

### Morning

* 8:30 - Get settled in, check their Ruby installs
* 9:00 - Discuss TDD in priniciple and try to assess their beginning skill/level & familiarity. You could use the bullets at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/testing/testing_fundamentals.html but do what you see fit.
* If they have no experience with TDD, then maybe use http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/testing/intro-to-tdd.html and frame Minitest as a good way to get started before diving into RSpec
* If they have some experience with TDD, then how about having them do some code retreat sessions (https://github.com/turingschool/code_retreat). Ideally there'd be a few other people to mix in (students, staff). Let me see what I can dig up.

### Afternoon

* Presuming the morning went ok, I think it'd make sense to start by reviewing RSpec's syntax so they're thinking about how a test suite is put together, how to use context/describe, let, etc.
* Then talk a bit about what testing looks like for Rails applications -- the differences between testing models, controllers, and features. What plusses and minuses there are to testing each level. The difference between inside-out and outside-in. That kind of thing.
* I'd guess it's close to 2PM then. You can have them start on ContactManager (http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/contact_manager.html). You could pair with one of them for the 2-3 hour and the other person the 3-4 hour.

Then, after that, let's talk and figure out how things went and what should be done the rest of the week.

## Tuesday

Maybe the morning working on http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html and talking about designing objects, how to deal with dependency injection or mocking/stubbing?

## Wednesday
